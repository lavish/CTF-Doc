A/D CTF Service Guidelines
==========================

This repository contains the guidelines for the development of A/D CTF services on frameworks compatible with the [ECSC 2022 Gameserver](https://github.com/ECSC2022/ctf-gameserver). The ECSC 2022 Gameserver is based on the [FAUST framework](https://github.com/fausecteam/ctf-gameserver, but it has been extended to introduce additional features, in particular the support for multiple flag stores per service and improved checker status messages.

These guidelines have been created during the development of the [ECSC 2022](https://ad.ecsc2022.eu/) A/D CTF and improved for the course [Attacks and Defenses in Computer Security (192.111)](https://tiss.tuwien.ac.at/course/educationDetails.xhtml?dswid=1954&dsrid=447&courseNr=192111) at [TU Wien](https://www.tuwien.at/). They are based on the experience of the organizers and they are intended to help the CTF developers to create high-quality services that can be easily integrated into the ECSC 2022 Gameserver.

The guidelines are organized in the following files:
* [SERVICE.md](SERVICE.md): guidelines for the development of A/D CTF services. This is the main document that you should read first.
* [SERVICE_PROPOSAL.md](SERVICE_PROPOSAL.md): template for the proposal of A/D CTF services. Writing a comprehensive proposal before starting the development of a service is a crucial step to spotting potential issues in the service design.
* [SERVICE_EVALUATION.md](SERVICE_EVALUATION.md): guidelines for the assessment of A/D CTF services. These guidelines are intended for the reviewers of the services during the testing phase before the competition.
* [template-service](template-service/): template for the development of A/D CTF services. This template can be used as a starting point for the development of a new service. (TODO)
